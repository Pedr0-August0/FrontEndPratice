      <h4 class="margin">The cats of America are under siege!</h4>

      <p class="margin">Long gone are the good old days when a cat’s biggest worries were mean dogs or a bath. Modern
        cats must
        confront
        satanists, online predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, and
        countless
        other threats to their nine lives.</p>

      <p class="margin">For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots have stood at the vanguard of our
        country's
        defense by
        helping to prepare our nation's cat owners for the difficult conversations they dread having with their
        pets.</p>

      <p class="margin">Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About Gun Safety answers crucial
        questions such as,
        “What
        is
        the right age to talk to my cat about the proper use of firearms?” and “What are the benefits of my cat
        living a
        lifestyle of abstinence?” and especially “Why does my cat need to use the internet? Can’t he just play with
        yarn
        like cats used to do?”</p>
